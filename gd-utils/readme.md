## General Instructions
Like Other Tools (Autorclone/Folderclone/Gclone/Fclone)  Gd-Utils is also based upon Service accounts aka SAs

 Among These tools Only Autorclone & Folderclone can generate SAs by themselves
 
>So for this tool to work you need SAs generated using [Autorclone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) or [Folderclone](https://github.com/Spazzlo/folderclone)

### ðŸ“¦ Pre Requisites:

ðŸ“£ This tool can be used in **Windows** , **Android** as well as **Linux OS**

ðŸ“£ You need Generated **SAs** (Like I mentioned above)

ðŸ“£ If you are using this in **Linux** or **Android** :-

Create a new Repo in Github and name it as `accounts` and Upload all your SAs (json files) there
